# Git Basics and GitHub Features

Git and GitHub Features
Version Control
Git provides version control, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate seamlessly.

Branching
Create branches to work on features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main codebase.

Pull Requests
Submit pull requests on GitHub to propose changes, discuss modifications, and merge code into the main branch.

Collaboration
GitHub facilitates collaboration by providing a centralized platform for code hosting, issue tracking, and documentation.

Welcome to the Git Basics and GitHub Features repository! This project serves as a quick reference for beginners to learn essential Git commands and understand the basic features of Git and GitHub.
